### Conditional Filtering and Aggregate Functions in SQL

1. **FROM**: The query starts by selecting data from the table.

2. **WHERE**: Filters the rows based on the given condition before any grouping or aggregation happens.

3. **GROUP BY**: Groups the data into subsets based on a specified column(s) to perform aggregate functions.

4. **HAVING**: Filters the grouped data after the aggregation (e.g., `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) has been applied.

5. **SELECT**: Calculates the aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, etc.) on the filtered data.

6. **ORDER BY**: Finally, orders the results based on specified columns or aggregate function values.

### Aggregate Functions:
- **COUNT**: Returns the number of rows that meet a specified condition or the total number of rows in a dataset.
- **SUM**: Adds up all the values in a numeric column.
- **AVG**: Returns the average (mean) of a numeric column.
